VoteCreator
===========

Stud.IP-plugin: creates votes from lists in a wiki page.

This works quite simple: 

* Go to a wiki page with some lists or add some lists there.
* Click on the voteicon on the top-right corner of the list.
* Now you should have jumped into the vote-section of studip with all the dots of the list as options of the upcoming voting.

Now you can edit the options, set the duration of the voting and start the voting. After you started the voting you are redirected back to the wiki-page you just saw. 
Sadly you won't see any success-message, but that is something this plugin can't provide.
